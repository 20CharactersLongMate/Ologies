    <h1>Autecology</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>The ecological factors that influence the distribution and abundance of a species.</li>
<li>The impact of a species on its environment and the role it plays in ecosystem dynamics.</li>
<li>The behavior of a species and its adaptations to its environment.</li>
<li>The population biology of a species, including factors that influence population growth and decline.</li>
<li>The role of a species in nutrient cycling and energy flow in an ecosystem.</li>
<li>The impacts of climate change on a species and its habitat.</li>
<li>The impacts of human activity on a species and its habitat.</li>
<li>The impacts of disease on a species and its population dynamics.</li>
<li>The impacts of predation on a species and its population dynamics.</li>
<li>The impacts of competition for resources on a species and its population dynamics.</li>
<li>The impacts of parasitism on a species and its population dynamics.</li>
<li>The impacts of mutualistic relationships (symbiotic relationships that benefit both species involved) on a species and its population dynamics.</li>
<li>The impacts of commensalism (symbiotic relationships in which one species benefits while the other is neither benefited nor harmed) on a species and its population dynamics.</li>
<li>The impacts of habitat destruction and degradation on a species and its population dynamics.</li>
<li>The impacts of invasions by non-native species on a species and its population dynamics.</li>
<li>The impacts of genetic diversity and evolution on a species and its population dynamics.</li>
