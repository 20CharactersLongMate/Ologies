    <h1>Audiology</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>The anatomy and physiology of the auditory system.</li>
<li>The measurement and assessment of hearing and hearing disorders.</li>
<li>The diagnosis and treatment of hearing and balance disorders.</li>
<li>The use of audiometric testing to assess hearing loss and other hearing disorders.</li>
<li>The use of hearing aids, cochlear implants, and other assistive devices to improve hearing.</li>
<li>The effects of noise exposure on hearing.</li>
<li>The use of electrophysiological techniques (such as auditory brainstem response and otoacoustic emissions testing) to assess hearing.</li>
<li>The use of imaging techniques (such as magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography) to study the auditory system.</li>
<li>The impact of hearing loss on cognitive development, language acquisition, and communication skills.</li>
<li>The effects of aging on hearing and hearing disorders.</li>
<li>The use of auditory training and rehabilitation to improve hearing and communication skills.</li>
<li>The use of pharmacological and surgical treatments for hearing and balance disorders.</li>
<li>The use of auditory prosthetics (such as cochlear implants) to improve hearing in individuals with severe hearing loss.</li>
<li>The use of audiologic assessment and treatment in newborns and young children.</li>
<li>The study of auditory processing disorders (disorders that affect how the brain processes auditory information).</li>
<li>The study of tinnitus (ringing in the ears) and its treatment.</li>
<li>The study of auditory neuropathy (a disorder that affects the auditory nerve and the brain's ability to process auditory information).</li>
<li>The study of auditory hallucinations (hearing voices or other sounds that are not present in the environment).</li>
<li>The study of auditory-verbal therapy (a treatment approach that uses auditory stimulation and verbal communication to improve language and communication skills).</li>
<li>The study of auditory-based approaches to cognitive rehabilitation (treatments that use auditory stimulation to improve cognitive function).</li>
