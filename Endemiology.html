    <ul>
      <li>The study of the distribution and determinants of diseases in populations</li>
<li>The identification of risk factors for diseases, including genetic, environmental, and social factors</li>
<li>The analysis of trends in disease prevalence over time and across different populations</li>
<li>The development and evaluation of interventions to prevent or control the spread of diseases</li>
<li>The use of epidemiological methods, including case-control studies, cohort studies, and randomized controlled trials, to study disease patterns and risk factors</li>
<li>The application of statistical methods, including multivariate analysis and survival analysis, to the study of disease patterns and risk factors</li>
<li>The use of geospatial techniques, such as spatial analysis and geographic information systems (GIS), to study the spatial distribution of diseases and risk factors</li>
<li>The use of electronic health records and other large data sets to study disease patterns and risk factors</li>
<li>The study of the social and economic impact of diseases on populations</li>
<li>The study of infectious diseases, including their transmission, prevention, and control</li>
<li>The study of non-infectious diseases, including chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer</li>
<li>The study of rare diseases and orphan drugs</li>
<li>The study of global health issues and the impact of diseases on global populations</li>
<li>The study of health disparities and inequities in disease burden among different population groups</li>
<li>The study of the social and cultural factors that influence health behaviors and disease outcomes</li>
<li>The use of public health surveillance systems to monitor the spread of diseases and evaluate the effectiveness of prevention and control measures</li>
<li>The use of health economics to study the costs and benefits of different disease prevention and treatment strategies</li>
<li>The use of qualitative research methods, such as interviews and focus groups, to understand the experiences and perspectives of individuals and communities affected by diseases</li>
<li>The use of participatory research approaches to engage communities in the research process and address their health needs</li>
